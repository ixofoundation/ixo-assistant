# Custom Actions

A custom action can run any code you want, including API calls, database queries etc. 
For the ixo Assistant, we have three general categories of Custom Actions:
1. Blockchain queries (e.g. transaction history for an account)
2. Interactions with the cellnode data stores (e.g. query a claim)
3. Integrations with third-party web services (e.g. fetch a geospatial satellite image for a claim evaluation)

Custom Actions are written in Python.
This repo contains reference custom action files. Please feel free to contribute new custom actions.
